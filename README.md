# PortfolioProject2

In order to stay competitive, it is imperative companies keep pace with changing technologies.
One of the ways to achieve this goal, is to identify future skills requirement.
This project seeks to analyze future skills requirement for a global IT and business consulting services firm
The project seeks to determine:
* The top programming skills in demand
* The top database skills in demand
* The top web frames and platforms

## Methodology

* Data was obtained from job postings, training portals and surveys using APIs and Web scraping.
* The data was explored to better understanding on what needed to be done.
* The data was then prepared for analysis by identifying and removing duplicate values, identifying and imputing missing values and normalizing data.
* Exploratory data analysis was then performed to derive insights to the question at hand.
* A Dashboard was created using IBM Cognos to display the findings.
